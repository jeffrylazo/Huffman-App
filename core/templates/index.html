        <p class="index_description">
            A request containing the text to be compressed is sent to the API. A huffman tree is 
            generated using the frequencies at which each of the symbols on the text appear. Once 
            all symbols have been processed, the uses the tree to assign a binary code with variable 
            length to each of them. This mapping is known as Huffman code, which can be stured in 
            the form of a dictionary in Python. Afterwards, the text is compressed with this code.

        <h2 class="index_header">Decompression Process</h2>
        <p class="index_description">
            The compressed text is reverted to its original form with the correct Huffman code. The 
            algorithm test each bit or group of bits against the ones in the code. If there is a match, 
            a symbol is assigned to it. Otherwise, the group increases by one bit and the process 
            starts again until all bits have been processed.
