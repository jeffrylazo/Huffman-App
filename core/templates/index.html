        <p class="index_description">
            A Huffman tree is generated using the frequencies of each of the symbols in the 
            text to be compressed. This tree assigns a binary code to each symbol. This mapping 
            is known as Huffman code. It can be stored in the form of a dictionary in Python. 
            This code is used to compress the given text.

        <h2 class="index_header">Decompression Process</h2>
        <p class="index_description">
            The compressed text is reverted to its original form using the Huffman code. The 
            algorithm test each bit or group of bits against the ones in the code. If there 
            is a match, a symbol is assigned to it. Otherwise, the group increases by one bit 
            and the process starts again until all bits have been processed.
